# Intelligent-Tutoring-for-Law-Courses-Accesebale-Prompts
Prompts and example interactions used in the paper â€œIntelligent Tutoring for Law Courses: Design and Evaluation of an LLM-based System". This repository provides the exact system prompts employed in our study, along with documentation to support reproducibility and reuse in related research. The prompts in the prompts/ folder are written in English and designed to support students in learning the IRAC method for legal case writing. These prompts were implemented in our system and evaluated in the associated paper.
The adapted prompts, available in the adapted_prompts/ folder, are currently only provided in German (focusing on the apprasial style). We are working on an English version, which will be made available soon.
